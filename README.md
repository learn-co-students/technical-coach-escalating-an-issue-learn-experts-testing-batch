# Escalating an Issue

![escalation](http://i.giphy.com/ToMjGpjpXMFPshSYGLm.gif)

Sometimes as a Technical Coach, you will encounter questions that are beyond your scope to answer. In these cases, you'll need to escalate the issue to the appropriate department at Flatiron.

## What kinds of issues should be reported?

### Admissions - Through the 'Assign to Enrollments' Button

- Questions about the course and admissions
  - How long does the course take?
  - What courses do you offer?
  - Do you offer scholarships?

Occasionally someone asks non-technical questions such as "How long does this course take to complete?", "Do you offer scholarships?", "Can you explain the job guarantee to me?", etc. If you feel like you know the answer, please **do not try and answer these questions**. Simply let the student know that this is a great question for our admissions team and that you're going to close this chat question and forward the question to them. Referring the questions to admissions will automatically resolve the question, so **it is imperative that you let the student know that the referral will resolve their question**.

Before resolving the question, you should also tell students that can contact admissions directly at `admissions@flatironschool.com`. Students may not be contacted by admissions immediately, so it is a good idea to give them a course of action to follow up - otherwise, they're likely to come to AAQ again! Once you get confirmation from the student that it is okay to refer them to admissions and resolve their question, hit the `Assign to Enrollments` button.

### Personal/Behavioral Escalation - Through Escalation Form, Slack, and Admin Profile

Students get a little frustrated all the time - learning to do something new is challenging! If a student is very frustrated or disheartened, or is otherwise not interacting with TCs and other students in a healthy way, that student needs to be escalated.  We use a google form to escalate students to members of the full time team. For extreme or urgent cases, you should also send a DM to Erika in the Flatiron Staff channel. Paste the message that concerned you and a link to the question so we can easily get in touch and review. It's also a good idea to leave a note on the student's admin profile - writing notes can help document a pattern of behavior and keep TCs and other staff in the loop.

If in doubt, send too many of these. If necessary, we'll refine the instructions but we'd rather get too many false positives than fail to help a student who's having a hard time.

### Struggling Student - Through Form and Admin Profile

If a paying student is struggling with the curriculum, we want to get them the appropriate help as soon as possible. At this point, you may have already tried to explain a concept to them, and/or documented it on their admin profile. If not, check their admin profile and see if there are other comments. If it seems there is a pattern developing based on the notes in their admin profile (eg there are several other notes by other TCs / staff members about the student struggling with concepts), **please email or Slack the Technical Coach manager immediately** about the student so we can get them help from the appropriate Section Lead.

### Abuse of AAQ or Lack of Trying -

### All other issues - Through Jira

In other cases, technical issues need to be escalated to our development team. The table below briefly outlines the types of issues that should be escalated:

| Issue | Description |
| --- | --- |
| IDE |  Any issues related to the Learn IDE. For example, the user is getting an error when installing the IDE, or the IDE won't load |
| Chat |  Issues related to Ask A Question, DM, or Lobby features in Learn, eg chat is totally empty, notifications not showing up for chat|
| UI |  Buttons not working, problems with the site, pages 500ing |
| Account | Billing, feature access, Github name change |
| Lights | Lights not flipping |
| Project | Issues related to an assessment / portfolio project |
| VirtualBox | Issues related to installing or using VirtualBox |
| Learn Gem | Eg User is getting non test errors when running tests or submitting lessons |
| Github |  Eg Github account not connecting to Learn.co |
| Blog | Student's Learn.co blog related issues - can't save blog posts, switching blog type, etc.

In the next section, we'll cover how to correctly escalate an issue by submitting a ticket on Jira.
